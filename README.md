# solid-bassoon
My first Project
1. Save it as `install_dwm.sh` in your home directory or any other convenient location.
2. Make it executable with the command: `chmod +x install_dwm.sh`
3. Run it with: `./install_dwm.sh`
- Create a .xinitrc file
After running the script, you should be able to start dwm by running `startx`.
